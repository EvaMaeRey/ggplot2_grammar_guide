# ggplot2_grammar_guide
a kind of formal introduction to ggplot2 in a flipbook

A data visualization is composed of
... geometric objects (points, lines, labels, columns)
... that take on aesthetics (color, size, position)
... which represent variables 
... in a dataset

The grammar of graphics implemented in ggplot2 has a lot in common with human languge.  I use grammar concepts from human language to help introduce ggplot2.
