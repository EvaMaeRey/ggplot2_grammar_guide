# Overview

In the following lab, you will answer some questions and create an annotated plot. 




# Background

In 1879–1883, Chile and Peru fought a war over resources.  What is the name of that war and what resource(s) were involved?  What other counrtry was involved? Not sure? You can search the web for this answer. 

> Answers the question in your lab

More recently a case was brought to the ICJ again over resources. *In a few sentences summarize the dispute.* Reference: https://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/137

> Answers the question in your lab

Now, check out the maps in the judgement:  https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/137/137-20140127-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf
In these maps, the water is colored blue. *Now, what color is the land?*  

> Answers the question in your lab

*How are the maps used to illuminate the dispute and ICJ's resolution of the dispute?  Which pages of the document contain these two maps?*

> Answers the question in your lab

*Beyond fishing, name a one commodity for Chile's and one of Peru's of great importance for each state's economy.* You may search the web!

### The data and existing plots 

Fisheries and Aquaculture Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations collects data on fisheries production of countries. [This Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_industry_by_country) 
lists fishery production of countries for 2005. For each country tonnage from 
capture and aquaculture are listed. Note that countries which harvested less 
than 100,000 tons are not included in the data. 

---

Given below are existing data visualizations that violate many data visualization best practices. *Describe some what you think some problems w/ these might be here.*

### Reading in the data

Your visualization will give important context to the ICJ case.  You will use the same data as used in the visualizations above, but will create better visualizations!  

### Install packages

What are the packages you need to install (in the console - not in the .Rmd!) to do this lab?  *Install them (in the console!).*

```{r load libraries}
library(tidyverse)
options(scipen = 10)  # scientific notation turns on later
```

### Importing data

The data cleaning has been done for you in the code below.  Check out the walk through here: https://evamaerey.github.io/little_flipbooks_library/data_cleaning/data_cleaning#26
Describe three or four data cleaning "moves" that you see done in this pipeline:

```{r data cleaning}
# using the htmltab package to scan html file
htmltab::htmltab(doc = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_industry_by_country",  
                 which = 2) ->  
fisheries_2015_raw
```


---

```{r}
# code to read in the data and clean it is done for you here
fisheries_2015_raw %>%  
  as_tibble() %>%  # show data in "tidyverse" way, as_tibble
  janitor::clean_names(case = "snake") %>%  # snake is the default too
  mutate(capture =  
           readr::parse_number(x = capture)) %>%  
  mutate(aquaculture =  
           readr::parse_number(x = aquaculture)) %>%  
  mutate(total =  
           readr::parse_number(x = total)) %>%  
  mutate(country = str_trim(string = country)) %>%  
  mutate(region =  
           countrycode::countrycode(  
             sourcevar = country,  
             origin = "country.name",  
             dest = "region")) %>%  
  # country codes are useful for merging data
  mutate(iso3c =  
           countrycode::countrycode(  
             sourcevar = country,  
             origin = "country.name",  
             dest = "iso3c")) %>%  
  # one row is an aggregation - deleting this
  filter(country != "Total (2015)") %>% 
  mutate(country = str_replace(country, "Â", "")) %>%  # on PCs this step seems to be required because of how the data is read in. # won't cause problems for mac. 
  mutate(country = str_trim(country)) %>%  # this is another cleaning step that is needed for PCs, and won't cause problems for mac.
  mutate(peru_or_chile = country == "Chile" | country == "Peru") ->   
fisheries
```

---


```{r}
# starting with fisheries, wrangle to only the peru and chile cases, and create the object...
fisheries %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Chile", "Peru")) ->
fisheries_peru_chile

save(fisheries, fisheries_peru_chile, file = "fisheries.Rdata")
```




### Data wrangling: creating a subset of fisheries

Now, in the next code chunk, create a subset of your data, containing only the Chile and Peru cases.  User `filter` on fisheries and create a new object called fisheries_peru_chile

```{r}
load("fisheries.Rdata")
```


### Create a scatter plot

- Create a scatter plot (geom_point) of capture v. aquaculture across all countries
- use color to represent the variable peru_or_chile
- Use the log10 scales for the x and y (scale_y_... )

- add a `geom_label()` layer and let the data for this layer be only `fisheries_peru_chile`.  You will need to add an `aes(label = ?)` statement to your ggplot.

- adjust labels for your *plot* as needed (title, subtitle, caption, x, y, color)
