# Punctuation: Small multiples

Punctuation helps us break up language into digestible pieces. Breaking up visualization can also be helpful.  

Creating *small multiples* also known as *faceting* is a powerful way to make data more digestible.   In ggplot, small plots based on a categorical variable can be visualized side by side.  


```{r facets, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2002) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap / 1000) +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, ncol = 2) +
  aes(color = continent) +
  facet_null() + # overrides facet_wrap
  facet_grid(
    pop > 10000000 ~ continent
    ) # overrides facet_null
```

# Greetings: Themes

It may seem just cosmetic, but themes can have a big impact on the look and feel of you final plot.  The thematic elements are what first meet the eye.  For more information on fine adjustment of thematic elements, have a look at the [taming ggplot themes flipbook](https://evamaerey.github.io/little_flipbooks_library/taming_themes_in_ggplot/taming_ggplot_themes.html#1).  For now, check out how to change the look and feel of your graph with some preset themes.  

```{r themes, eval = F, echo= F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2002) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  geom_point() +
  aes(color = continent) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme_light(base_size = 5, 
              base_family = "Times") + 
  theme_classic(base_size = 15,
                base_family = "Rockwell") +
  theme_dark() +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggdark::dark_theme_dark() +
  ggthemes::theme_excel()

name: saving

# The written language: Save plots as objects and to disk

Now you should know how to build a ggplot.  How can you save that plot?  

First, you can save the entire plot as an object using the assignment operatore `<-`.  Below we call the plot `g`.  Then use the function ggsave() to save out your plot.  

```{r}
g <- ggplot(gapminder_2002) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  geom_point() 

ggsave(filename = "my_plot.png", 
       plot = g)
```





```{css, eval = TRUE, echo = F}
.remark-code{line-height: 1.5; font-size: 70%}
```


<!-- ```{r, dpi=400, eval = F} -->
<!-- gapminder %>%  -->
<!--   select(continent) %>%  -->

<!-- Or at least an organized twitter thread!?  Another idea for you: pull aes() out of ggplot(). Do you do it? Lot's of reasons to do it! Downside is currently most examples make use of nested approach. @grrrck does this too, and esquisse -->

<!-- ggplot(data = my_data) +  -->
<!--    aes(x = my_var) -->

<!-- Is it possible to do this with multiple geoms? I usually specify aes within the geom like  -->

<!-- ggplot(data) + -->
<!--   geom_point(aes(x, y)) + -->
<!--   geom_line(aes(x, y, group = id))  -->

<!-- I prefer this approach because it's explicit which aesthetics are bound to which geoms -->

<!-- My blog post, (which no one has probably ever read) exactly on this topic! https://evangelinereynolds.netlify.com/post/mapping-aesthetics/ â€¦ In general I'd say go global.  I think in general, most folks don't have a bunch of conflicts for aesthetics geom by geom (though occasionally yes?).  Let me know what you think! -->
