<!-- # For teachers -->

<!-- This is a collection of thoughts about how to teach ggplot2, and any other grammar of graphics type data visualization system.   -->

<!-- It is tempting to rush to build a publication-ready plot right out of the gate.   -->

<!-- But maybe we should resist this temptation. Maybe we should "hang out" in each of the component zones for a bit.  Explore. Get comfy in a zone.  Then move on. -->




# Introduction

ggplot2 is an implementation of the "grammar of graphics" for R.  The grammar of graphics is a framework that enables users to go beyond fixed chart types by mapping variables of a dataset to the aesthetics characteristics of geometric objects.  

The goal of the package is to "'bring together in a coherent way things that previously appeared unrelated and which also will provide a basis for dealing systematically with new situations'". (D.R. Cox 1978 quoted in Wickham 2010)

This system  its user great expressive freedom, as they are not confined to predetermined chart types.  The grammar of graphics tool gives the user the control to build nearly any chart tha she imagines.  

Nevertheless, many folks use ggplot2 without much fluency --- copying and pasting existing code and making minor tweeks to get the results they want.  Without a theoretical knowledge of the framework, it is unlikely that users will completely unlock the freedom that ggplot2 graphing library affords.  

This book seeks to provide an introduction to ggplot2 that will provide a basis for fluency with this framework.

# Loading packages

ggplot2 is part of a set of packages designed to be used together called the tidyverse.  Before we can use the package we must load it.  For the examples we'll use data from the gapminder package, so we'll load that too.

---

```{r libraries, eval = F, echo = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
```


`r apply_reveal("libraries")`

---

# Prepping data

We'll also prep some data --- `gapminder_2002` and `gapminder_oceania`  --- which are a subset of the data made available in the gapminder data package.  

We won't go into detail about data manipulation much here, but more basic info about data wrangling in flipbook style can be found here [The Tidyverse in Action](https://evamaerey.github.io/tidyverse_in_action/tidyverse_in_action.html).

---

```{r prep_data, eval = T, echo = F}
gapminder %>% # data from package
  filter(year == 2002) -> # filtering
gapminder_2002 # saving subset object
gapminder %>% 
  select(country, continent) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(country_count = n()) ->
continent_aggregate
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Oceania") ->
gapminder_oceania
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "New Zealand") ->
gapminder_new_zealand
```

`r apply_reveal("prep_data")`

---

# The declarative mood: declaring data

The data is a "first class citizen" the Grammar of Graphics and tidyverse framework.  Therefore, the first step to creating a plot, not surprisingly, is declaring data. 

Let's do it.

---

```{r declare_data, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2002) # That's all!
```

`r apply_reveal("declare_data")`

---

name: aes


# The interogative mood:  aes() is pronounced "ask"

<!-- > aes(color = temperature) translates to "Please represent 'temperature' for me, color aesthetic!"  -->


"Aesthetic mapping" refers to the representation that different aesthetic components do in a data visualization.   Aesthetics representing values is what does most of the work for us in a data visualization. 

Differences in values --- which can be painstaking to differentiate in their "raw" form in a table as text --- are easy to differentiate when represented by position, color, size and so on.  Aesthetic mapping is what makes data visualization so powerful and worthwhile.  


---

# Pool of aesthetics?

What are the aesthetics that can be used to communicate about variation?   Let's see how we request an aesthetic to represent a variable from our dataset for us.  We'll first look at the x position and y position.  

<!-- Consumers of data visualization understand the importance of aesthetic mapping intuitively.  But some may feel overwhelmed by the terminology.  To overcome this in ggplot, we might personify things a bit and pronounce `aes()` --- the function used for specifying aesthetic mapping in ggplot2 --- as "ask".   -->



<!-- "Mapping" in the phrase "aesthetic mapping" can be understood as representation, and aesthetics are that general category of things we visually differentiate: color, position, size, shape, etc. -->


<!-- So the statement `aes(x = gdpPercap)`, can be translated to 'asking the x position to represent the variable gdpPercap.'  The statement `aes(color = continent)` can be understood as 'asking the color aesthetic to represent the variable continent.' -->

<!-- --- -->

  

<!-- People don't always "get" ggplot2 right away.   -->

<!-- One of the hurdles is aes() statements -- the aesthetic mapping statements.   -->

<!-- I try to say "aesthetic mapping" when talking about aes() w/ newcomers, saying "'mapping' as in representation." Then translate into plainer language, "What variable are we asking the aesthetic (color, x-position, shape, etc.) to represent?"  aes() is "asking" -- *asking* very nicely for a specific aesthetic to do us a favor. So  -->



<!-- --- -->

<!-- ## Whom to "ask"? -->

<!-- It is probably a good idea to start by speaking in general terms about the variety of aesthetics that might represent values at once.  You can also talk about the appropriateness of the various aesthetics for representing different value types - like numerical, categorical or ordinal data.  -->

---

I think it is pretty useful to talk the many aesthetics at once as is done by here @ClausWilke: https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/aesthetic-mapping.html#aesthetics-and-types-of-data …  

```{r, out.width="90%", echo = F, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/aesthetic_mapping_files/figure-html/common-aesthetics-1.png")
```



---

```{r x_and_y, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2002) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +    # x position
  aes(y = lifeExp) +      # y position
```


`r apply_reveal("x_and_y")`


---

The aes() statement says that we want the variable gdpPercap mapped to the x position, and the variable lifeExp mapped to the y position.  The x and y scales give us a clue that this info is registered.

But, we don't really have any insight about our data yet.  Why?  Because aesthetics are taken on by geometric objects.  We still need to declare what geometric object will take on the aesthetics.  Let's see how, when we add a geometric object "point", the x and y position for each row of data are taken on by that object.  

---



```{r, geom_for_aes, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2002) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +    # x position
  aes(y = lifeExp) +      # y position
  geom_point() 
```


`r apply_reveal("geom_for_aes")`

---


## Exploring more aesthetic mappings

But let's not get distracted by geoms (we'll come back to these).  Aesthetic mapping is what is doing so much work for us in data vis. Let's see a few more aesthetic mappings.

Let's explore a bunch of the *aesthetic* that we might *map* our data to.  

So far, we have have stated x and y positions - these are *required* aesthetics for the "point" geometry. 

But more are *optional.*  We do all of the required aesthetic mapping and then also practice other allowable aesthetics for geom point - color, shape, size, alpha.  We'll also see that double or tripple mapping is allowed -- mapping the same variable to multiple aesthetics.  

<!-- Note to teachers: Depending on your data set you might run out of unique variables to map to aesthetics, but mapping variables to multiple aesthetics can expose students to more aesthetic mappings - even though this might not be desirable in actual work product.   And go ahead and do a lot of double mapping of the same variables in the learning phase.   -->

---


```{r aesthetics_point, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2002) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +    # x position
  aes(y = lifeExp) +      # y position
  geom_point() +  # above aes are required for point
  aes(color = continent) +  # color
  aes(shape = continent) +  # shape
  aes(size = pop) +   # size
  aes(alpha = pop)    # transparency +
  aes(color = lifeExp) # overwriting color's representation
```


---




`r apply_reveal("aesthetics_point")`

---

Other aesthetics can be explored by changing the geom to one that allows additional aesthetics such as geom_line().  Using geom_line(), you can demonstrate many of the same aesthetics as before and add linetype as well.

[Or I'm on the fast track, take me to the next session](#scales)

---

```{r aesthetics_line, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_oceania) +
  aes(x = year) +
  aes(y = pop) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  aes(group = country) +    # subsets data by var
  aes(color = country) +
  aes(linetype = country) +  # linetype
  aes(linetype = NULL) +     
  aes(size = year) +
  aes(alpha = year)
```

`r apply_reveal("aesthetics_line")`

---

A final visualization lets us look at the fill aesthetic too.  This is good chance to talk about the difference between the fill and color aesthetic.  

[Or I'm on the fast track, take me to the next session](#scales)


---

```{r aesthetics_area, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = continent_aggregate) +
  aes(x = continent) +
  aes(y = country_count) +
  geom_col() +
  aes(color = continent) +
  aes(linetype = continent) +
  aes(fill = continent) + # fill color for areas  
  aes(alpha = continent)
```


`r apply_reveal("aesthetics_area")`

---

## Questions:

- What are *required aesthetics* vs. optional? 

- What are the names of seven different aesthetics that we used above?

- What is the difference between the fill and color aesthetic? 

- What is the group aesthetic?

- Look at the help for geom_text.  What are the required aesthetics?  What are some aesthetics that we haven't covered above, that are optional for geom_text()?

---

# Modifiers

We are able to learn something about our data with very few inputs with ggplot2!  Part of the reason for this is there are convenient and reasonable defaults for the plot related to the aesthetics.   

There are default for

1. scales (we have seen a "blues" color scale, but it could be greens, or yellows)
2. scale labels (the col)
3. 

This makes exploring your data pretty quick.

What defines exactly how aesthetics.  But perhaps we are not

---

name: scales

## Modifiers: Asking for modification with scales\_\*\_\* 

> Please, sir, can I have some more?

With the aes() statement.

But we can then go back and ask for more with scales\_\* statements.  These statements provide a quick way to update our preferences for all the mapped aesthetics.   

Start with an scales_x_* and look at the variety of scale options associated with the x position aesthetic.  


---

## Scales


First let's have look at a variety of scaling options that come with the x position aesthetic:  

- scale_x_log10()
- scale_x_reverse()
- scale_x_sqrt()


---


```{r x_scales, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2002) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  geom_point() +  # this much is familiar #REVEAL
  scale_x_log10() + # overrides default  #REVEAL
  scale_x_reverse() + # overrides log10  #REVEAL
  scale_x_sqrt() # overrides reverse  #REVEAL
```

`r apply_reveal("x_scales", user_reveal_defined = T)`


---

### More aesthetic scale modifications

Analogously, we can use scale\_\*\_\* statements to modify other aesthetic scales.  Here are some examples

<!-- I think people find it easy to think about x and y position and adjusting those scales, and related adjustment like labs() and scale_*, but we teachers need to help extend these logics to the other aesthetics.  -->


- scale_x_log10() 
- scale_y_reverse(limits = c(100, 0)) 
- scale_color_viridis_d() 
- scale_shape_discrete(solid = F) 
- scale_size_continuous(breaks = c(100, 1000, 10000, 100000)) 
- scale_alpha(range = c(.5, 1)) # full transparency is 0


Let's tour several of those to get a taste.  

---

```{r scales, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2002) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  geom_point() +
  aes(color = continent) +
  aes(size = gdpPercap) +
  aes(shape = continent) +
  aes(alpha = gdpPercap) + # We've done this much #REVEAL
  scale_x_log10() +  #REVEAL
  scale_y_reverse(limits = c(100, 0)) +  #REVEAL
  scale_color_viridis_d() +  #REVEAL
  scale_shape_discrete(solid = F) +  #REVEAL
  scale_size_continuous(  
    breaks = c(100, 1000, 10000, 100000),
    limits = c(0, 100000)) + #REVEAL
  scale_alpha(range = c(.3, .8)) #REVEAL
```

`r apply_reveal("scales", user_reveal_defined = T)`

---

## Questions:

- What does the parameter "breaks" seem to control?

- What are some additional color scales that can be used?  Use auto complete in RStudio.  (i.e. type "scale_color" and then "tab" to see your options)

- What does "d" stand for in the scale_color_viridis_d()? Use the help pane.

- While you are in the help pane, see how would you set missing values (NA) to "black".



---

name: labs

## Modifiers II:  Asking for modification -- labels

Aesthetic scales also get default *labels* -- the variable names.  We can also "ask again" to make modifications to these.  

The syntax is labs(\* = "New label"), where the \* is the aesthetic name.  

---

```{r labs, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2002) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  geom_point() +
  aes(color = continent) +
  aes(shape = continent) +
  aes(size = gdpPercap) +
  aes(alpha = gdpPercap) + # this much is familiar #REVEAL
  labs(x = "GDP per cap") + #REVEAL
  labs(y = "Life Expectency") + #REVEAL
  labs(color = "Continent") + #REVEAL
  labs(shape = "Continent") + #REVEAL
  labs(size = "GDP per cap") + #REVEAL
  labs(alpha = "GDP per cap") + #REVEAL
  # Note: labs is also used to adjust *plot* labels
  labs(title = "GDP per Cap versus Life Expectancy\nin 2002") + #REVEAL
  labs(subtitle = "Data: Gapminder Data in R") + #REVEAL
  labs(caption = "Visualization: @EvaMaeRey") + #REVEAL
  labs(tag = "Plot 1") #REVEAL
```


`r apply_reveal("labs", user_reveal_defined = T)`

---

## Questions:

- When might you use labs(tag = )?
- What does the character string "\n" do in the place of a space in the plot title?
- Color and shape variables represent the same variable, and labs(color = \*) labs(shape = \*) have the same input, "Continent".  What does this mean for the legend? Change the labels to be different and see.
- Change the y label to an empty string, '""'.  What does this do?  



---

name: coords

## Modifiers III:  Asking for modification of the coordinate system

Now, let's quickly check out some of the different options for coordinates systems.

---

```{r coords, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2002) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_equal() +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 400) +
  coord_flip() +
  coord_polar()
```

`r apply_reveal("coords")`


---

name: geoms


<!-- But beyond understanding the philosophy, practice (including when things fail, and figuring out why they fail) is really important. Why initiatives like #tidytuesday are so valuable. -->

<!-- My blog post, (which no one has probably ever read) exactly on this topic! https://evangelinereynolds.netlify.com/post/mapping-aesthetics/ … In general I'd say go global.  I think in general, most folks don't have a bunch of conflicts for aesthetics geom by geom (though occasionally yes?).  Let me know what you think! -->


# Nouns:  The geom_*() pile on

It is probably not good practice to include too many geoms in any one plot that you present.  But it might be instructive to go ahead do so in teaching.  

This will allow people to see how new-to-them geoms relate directly to each other.  We can set opacity (alpha) to a high level to avoid completely blocking out previous geometric layers (which previews the unmapped aesthetic topic - coming up). 

In the first example many "variables" are computed on the fly, like the 0 represented by xend and yend and the mean of life exectency and per capita GDP. A point for discussion.  

---



## Bivariate continuous


---

```{r geom_2_continuous, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(gapminder_2002) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  aes(y = pop) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_tile(width = 100) +
  aes(xend = 0) +
  aes(yend = 0) +
  geom_segment(alpha = .2) +
  geom_curve() +
  aes(xmin = 0) +
  aes(xmax = gdpPercap) +
  aes(ymin = 0) + 
  aes(ymax = pop) +
  geom_rect(alpha = .2) +
  geom_line() +
  aes(label = country) +
  geom_text() +
  geom_label()
```

`r apply_reveal("geom_2_continuous")`

---

## Questions

- How is geom_tile() different from geom_point()? Look at the help.

- What aesthetics are required for geom_rect?

- How many geometric layers are in the final plot?

- Does order of the geom_*() statements matter to the end result?  How?








---

## Two continuous variables

There are a lot of geometric objects that can be used to represent *two continuous variables*.  To explore a few more we can start a new plot.

# The conditional mood: geom specific data, aesthetic mapping, and unmapped aesthetics

---

## Part i. geom specific aesthetic mapping

So far we have seen *global* aesthetic mapping, where aes() is an independent statement and therefore, where the aesthetic representation is applied to all geoms.  However, we can be specific about which geoms should take on the aesthetic representation, if we use aes() within the geom_*() statement.  

An example is shown below.  Note that you can use mapped aesthetic (asks) and unmapped aesthetics (demands) in the geom_\*() call.   

---

```{r geom_specific_aes_mapping, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2002) +
  # global aesthetics
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +  
  aes(y = lifeExp) +  
  geom_point() +
  aes(xend = 0) + # required aes for segment
  aes(yend = 0) + # required aes for segment
  # geom specific aesthetics:
  geom_segment(
    # mapping does not apply to geom_point
    mapping = aes(color = continent)
    ) 
```

`r apply_reveal("geom_specific_aes_mapping")`





---

## Part ii. Being a dictator -- unmapped aesthetics (Imparative mode)

*Mapped* aesthetics contrast with unmapped, across-the-board, aesthetics for a geometric object.  

geom_point(color = "blue"), is an imperative -- not an ask.  A dictator move.  "Do this everywhere." It is good to show a plot with two of the same geom layer, one with mapped aesthetics and the other without.

```{r unmapped_aes, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2002) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  geom_point() + # takes global aesthetics
  aes(color = continent) + 
  aes(shape = continent) +
  aes(size = gdpPercap) +
  aes(alpha = gdpPercap) +
  geom_point(
    color = "plum4", # specified
    size = 4, # aesthetics not in aes()are 
    shape = "square", # across the board
    alpha = .3  # for this geom
    )
```

---

`r apply_reveal("unmapped_aes")`

---

## Part iii.  Going *local* with data

```{r local_data, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2002) + # global data
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +  # global aesthetics
  aes(y = lifeExp) +    # global aesthetics
  geom_point(color = "grey") + 
  geom_line(
    # defining new zealand data for line geom
    data = gapminder_new_zealand,
    # and unmapped aesthetics for a geom
    # red across the board
    color = "red",
    # year mapped to size aesthetic
    mapping = aes(size = year) 
             )
```

           label = "Hello",
           color = "blue") +
  annotate(geom = "curve",
           x = 3000,
           y = 80, 
           xend = 10000,
           yend = 60,
           color = "green",
           arrow = arrow())
```

`r apply_reveal("annotate")`

## Convenience geoms

Some convenience functions have also been written for annotation using the geom_*() syntax. 

- geom_abline()
- geom_hline()
- geom_vline()

---

```{r annotation_geoms, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2002) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(slope = .01, intercept = 0) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 70, 
             linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(1000, 10000),
             linetype = "dashed")
```

`r apply_reveal("annotation_geoms")`

name: facets

# Punctuation: Small multiples

Punctuation helps us break up language into digestible pieces. Breaking up visualization can also be helpful.  

Creating *small multiples* also known as *faceting* is a powerful way to make data more digestible.   In ggplot, small plots based on a categorical variable can be visualized side by side.  


```{r facets, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2002) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap / 1000) +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, ncol = 2) +
  aes(color = continent) +
  facet_null() + # overrides facet_wrap
  facet_grid(
    pop > 10000000 ~ continent
    ) # overrides facet_null
```

name: themes

# Greetings: Using preset available themes

It may seem just cosmetic, but themes can have a big impact on the look and feel of you final plot.  The thematic elements are what first meet the eye.  

```{r themes, eval = F, echo= F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2002) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  geom_point() +
  aes(color = continent) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme_light(base_size = 5, 
              base_family = "Times") + 
  theme_classic(base_size = 15,
                base_family = "Rockwell") +
  theme_dark() +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggdark::dark_theme_dark() +
  ggthemes::theme_excel()
```

name: saving

# The written language: Save plots as objects and to disk

```{r}
g <- ggplot(gapminder_2002) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  geom_point() 

ggsave(filename = "my_plot.png", 
       plot = g)
```

## What is a pie chart?

---

```{r pie, eval = F, echo = F}
  ggplot(data = gapminder_2002) +
  aes(x = 1, fill = continent) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme_void() +
  labs(fill = "") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = 
                         "cividis")
```

# Clarification and disclaimers

---

# Our code doesn't look like other examples I've seen

This book uses a "slow ggplot" style, which is a bit verbose and is not all that typical. More often, you will see global aesthetics tucked together in the ggplot statement. Also, labs statements will typically be nested together. Finally, you might not see every parameter spelled out, rather position in the function is used to indicate the parameters being set. 


```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(gapminder_2002, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "GDP per Cap",
       y = "Life Expectancy",
       title = "My Title")
```

# Other great resources

There are many great resources about ggplot2.  As noted above, the prefered syntax is a bit different than mine. 

- [the ggplot2 website](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/) is the definitive guide
- there is an [RStudio Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) on ggplot2 which is a great quick reference
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) is also an excellent resource

# I noticed that we've made some ugly charts

This book is not aimed at advising on chart design principles.  In ggplot2 it is possible to make a lot of design mistakes.  

For discussion of best practices in creating informative and attractive charts you might there are many old and new classics including:

- [Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction, Kieran Healy](http://socviz.co)
- [Fundamentals of Data Visualization, Claus Wilke](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/)
